## Where to go instead

| need | package |
|---|---|
| Browser WebGPU executor | `kotoba-lang/webgpu` |
| Game browser host (ECS/input/ui/audio) | `kotoba-lang/host` |
| Engine SDK (ECS/render-IR) | `kotoba-lang/kami-engine-sdk` |
| Input map | `kotoba-lang/kami-engine-input-map` |
| Domain IR (gpu/webgl/dance/…) | sibling `kotoba-lang/*` packages |

Do not add new code here.

## Status

Docs-only. The former `.cljc` file contained only an `ns` declaration and no
contract, data, function, or runtime behavior, so it was retired rather than
renamed into a misleading empty `.kotoba` module.

See [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-retire-empty-cljc-scaffold.md).
